# Contributing to The Burner Games


## Development Guidance (for all levels)

### Installation

Installation is very basic and simular to any Ruby on Rails application.

1. Install a ruby development environment
1. Install Ruby 2.1.7 (which is that's what we are running on). Ruby 2.2.x is out for awhile but still consider to be new, it's possible to upgrade yet 2.1.7 is enough for out needs at the moment.
1. Install bundle gem using `gem install bundle` (make sure to avoid using sudo, if you require to install using sudo you're probably doing something wrong)

1. clone the `burning-games` repo to your local machine and navigate to it
1. run `bundle install` (or just `bundle`) And wait for bundler to fetch all back dependencies. Those dependancies are mainly Rails, but some others (see Gemfile for complete list).
